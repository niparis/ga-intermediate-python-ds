# Intermediate Python for Data

General Assembly Class Material

Run your notebook from this folder

To run the notebook:

1. Open the terminal (Win+R, cmd, enter)
2. Navigate to this folder (using the "cd" command)
3. Run `jupyter notebook`


### Windows users

I suggest downloading [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) to make working with the command line a bit less painful on windows.
